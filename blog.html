                    <p>In a world of big tech oligarchies, rising fascism, and artificial intelligence, we must make our authentic voices heard; we must make the internet weird again. As a society, we have gotten so lost in the realm of algorithms and instant gratification. In an effort to combat this spiral toward automation, we must deconstruct the internet to its bare bones and learn how to manipulate it ourselves; we have to learn the language of the enemy. The Critical Art Ensemble promotes the use of tactical media as a means of “digital interventionism”. They also put forth the idea that it’s able to challenge pre-existing structures of power and offers a way to interact with, understand, and reconstruct the given technology (Critical Art Ensemble 7). </p>

                    <p>Through tactical media, there is a way out. Whether utilized for broader scale activism, such as <a href="http://www.artandsurveillance.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">The Art and Surveillance Project</a>, or for more focused community organizing, like a <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1jyJ-NM2qP-iRk1LJ8l3dc7e0M3IhHlo3E7Agvo9JOAQ/htmlview" target="_blank" rel="noopener">spreadsheet of needed items after a disaster</a>, tactical media gives us a chance to use often destructive and harmful technology for good. Simply learning how to build a website, such as this one, allows us to work with this technology from the bottom up and create something that is wholly ours. The internet, which was initially put forth as a method of worldwide communication, has done more dividing than connecting through the use of targeted algorithms and the spread of hateful ideals. Those with progressive ideas seem to shy away from new technologies due to the co-optation by tech giants and conservatives, but these are the tools necessary for revolution. Activist and Poet Audre Lorde may have said poignantly, “The master's tools will never dismantle the master's house,” but with the current pervasiveness of technology, I believe we must shift our focus to understanding the tools, so we have the ability to combat them. </p>

                    <p>With this site, I hope to create a fuller picture of myself than I can portray on a content-limited platform like Instagram or TikTok. I aim to create a site that showcases my interests, personality, and dreams all in one place. By creating a positive and hopeful site, I am trying to reminisce on the initial dream of global connectivity on the internet, as well as learn how to manipulate the structures I use every day without thinking twice. </p>
